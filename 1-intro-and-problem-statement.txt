Hello everyone. 

Today, we’d like to introduce our project focused on predicting online shoppers’ purchasing intent. In simple terms, our goal is to determine during a single browsing session whether a visitor will end up completing a purchase.

Think of a typical online shopping session—visitors browse products, compare prices, read reviews, and decide whether or not to buy. Our model analyzes this behavior by looking at various signals such as the number of pages visited, the time spent on product pages, bounce and exit rates, and other engagement metrics. Based on these insights, the model predicts whether the session will convert into a sale.

Now, why is this important from a business perspective? In the competitive world of e-commerce, every visitor counts. Early identification of purchase intent allows businesses to intervene in real time. For example, if our model detects a high likelihood of purchase, the system can trigger personalized offers—like targeted discounts or customized product recommendations. These timely interventions can significantly improve conversion rates by addressing hesitations at the exact moment they arise.

Moreover, this proactive approach not only enhances the customer experience but also optimizes marketing efforts. By focusing resources on sessions with higher purchase potential, businesses can boost revenue and improve overall efficiency. In essence, our predictive model serves as a vital tool in transforming raw browsing data into actionable insights that drive sales and foster customer loyalty.

In summary, we’re harnessing data-driven techniques to predict purchase behavior, enabling real-time, personalized customer engagement that ultimately leads to higher conversion rates and increased revenue. 

For this exercise we are using the Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains 12,330 sessions collected over one year and captures key metrics such as page views, time spent on various pages, bounce rates, and exit rates. This dataset, with its mix of numerical, categorical, and binary features, presents a realistic challenge due to its significant class imbalance — with only about 15.5% of sessions resulting in a purchase — making it ideal for developing and testing predictive models in an e-commerce setting.
